        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It{" "}
        <br></br>
        has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
        over 2000 years old.<br></br> Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur,
        <br></br> from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
        word in classical literature, discovered the <br></br>undoubtable
        source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
        Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" The<br></br> Extremes of Good and Evilby
        Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
        ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br></br>The first line of
        Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
        section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum <br></br> used since
        the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
        1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero <br></br>are also
        reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
        <br></br>versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
